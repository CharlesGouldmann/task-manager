# TaskManager

## Requirements
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and Yarn

## Initial setup
Install the necessary packages with `yarn` (npm is going to complain about dependencies). If you want to use npm simply run it with the `--force` flag: `npm i --force`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
